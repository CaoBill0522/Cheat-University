          <h2 class="title">About</h2>
          <p>
            Wild Chicken University (also known as a diploma mill or degree
            mill) is an organization that awards academic degrees and diplomas
            with substandard or no academic study and without recognition by
            official educational accrediting bodies. The purchaser can then
            claim to hold an academic degree, and the organization is motivated
            by making a profit. These degrees are often awarded based on vaguely
            construed life experience. Some such organizations claim
            accreditation by non-recognized/unapproved accrediting bodies set up
            for the purposes of providing a veneer of authenticity. While the
            terms "degree mill" and "diploma mill" are commonly used
            interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is
            sometimes drawn: <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              A "degree mill" issues "real" diplomas from non regionally
              accredited "universities", which may be legal in some states but
              are generally illegitimate universities.
            </li>
            <li>
              A "diploma mill" issues counterfeit diplomas which bear the
              names of legitimate universities.
            </li>
          </ul>
